make sure your repositories are related to this...
like if your repo is related to dsa then make sure upload your repo in dsa folder if not available then make folder by "\" symbol.
ex:-i made a hello world program in c++ language then ,
if C++ folder didnt made then i have to submit repo like this:-C/hello_World.cpp
like this....hope you will understand
